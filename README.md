# TimeProject
After tracking almost every single study session during my three year Bachelor, this project involves my attempts at refreshing my programming, statistics, and data analysis knowledge using said data while also learning about the uses of git and GitHub.     

The plans for this project are as follows: 

1. Prepare the data in Excel. 
2. Create the appropriate database using mySQL Workbench.
3. Connecting said database to Tableau to visualise some of the main variables. 
4. Using R to create a multiple regression model that will be developed and tested on the data.
5. Using Python to apply several clustering algorithms. 
6. Create a final markdown report integrating the different aspects of the project.

While working on this project, I will rely on git and GitHub to track changes and share my progress.
